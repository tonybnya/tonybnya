# 💫 About Me :

Backend Engineer specializing in the design of robust APIs and backend architectures for highly complex projects (SaaS, data, research, Fintech, business platforms).
I help startups, researchers, and organizations transform complex technical ideas into reliable, maintainable, and scalable systems, primarily using Python (Flask, FastAPI, Django).

- Notable project: development of a technology glossary application used in a PhD thesis (Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada), 80% validated by the academic jury.
- Business results: +20% bookings and +35% customer conversion on e-commerce platforms developed for local businesses.

My unusual career path (nearly 10 years in diplomacy before tech) allows me to work effectively with non-technical stakeholders and international teams.
Open to backend-heavy collaborations, freelance assignments, projects with international impact, or employment with a clear career progression and impact rewardings.
